      long_desc <<-DOC
        Start a stub service with the given pact file(s) or directories. Pact URIs may be local
        file or directory paths, or HTTP.
        Include any basic auth details in the URL using the format https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URI.
        Where multiple matching interactions are found, the interactions will be sorted by
        response status, and the first one will be returned. This may lead to some non-deterministic
        behaviour. If you are having problems with this, please raise it on the pact-dev google group,
        and we can discuss some potential enhancements.
        Note that only versions 1 and 2 of the pact specification are currently fully supported.
        Pacts using the v3 format may be used, however, any matching features added in v3 will
        currently be ignored.
