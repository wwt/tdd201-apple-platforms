Could not find one or more provider states.
Have you required the provider states file for this consumer in your pact_helper.rb?
If you have not yet defined these states, here is a template:
<% consumers.keys.each do | consumer_name | %>
Pact.provider_states_for "<%= consumer_name %>" do
<% consumers[consumer_name].each do | provider_state | %>
  provider_state "<%= provider_state %>" do
    set_up do
      # Your set up code goes here
    end
  end
<% end %>
end
<% end %>
