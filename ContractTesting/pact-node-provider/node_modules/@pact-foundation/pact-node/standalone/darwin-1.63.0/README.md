### pact-stub-service

```
Usage:
  pact-stub-service PACT_URI ...

Options:
  -p, [--port=PORT]        # Port on which to run the service
  -h, [--host=HOST]        # Host on which to bind the service
                           # Default: localhost

      [--sslkey=SSLKEY]    # Specify the path to the SSL key to use when running the service over HTTPS

Description:
  Start a stub service with the given pact file(s) or directories. Pact URIs may be
  local file or directory paths, or HTTP. Include any basic auth details in the
  URL using the format https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URI. Where multiple matching
  interactions are found, the interactions will be sorted by response status,
  and the first one will be returned. This may lead to some non-deterministic
  behaviour. If you are having problems with this, please raise it on the
  pact-dev google group, and we can discuss some potential enhancements. Note
  that only versions 1 and 2 of the pact specification are currently fully
  supported. Pacts using the v3 format may be used, however, any matching
  features added in v3 will currently be ignored.

  command line options.

  SCENARIOS

  # If every build goes straight to production

  Check the status of the pacts for a pacticipant version. Note that this only
  checks that the most recent verification for each pact is successful. It
  doesn't provide any assurance that the pact has been verified by the
  *production* version of the provider, however, it is sufficient if you are
  doing true continuous deployment.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --version VERSION
  --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  # If every build does NOT go straight to production

  ## Recommended approach

  If all applications within the pact network are not being deployed continuously
  (ie. if there is a gap between pact verification and actual deployment) then
  the following strategy is recommended. Each application version should be
  tagged in the broker with the name of the stage (eg. test, staging,
  production) as it is deployed (see the pact-broker create-version-tag CLI).
  This enables you to use the following very simple command to check if the
  application version you are about to deploy is compatible with every other
  application version already deployed in that environment.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --version VERSION --to
  TAG --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  ## Other approaches

  If you do not/cannot tag every application at deployment, you have two options.
  You can either use the very first form of this command which just checks that
  the *latest* verification is successful (not recommended as it's the
  production version that you really care about) or you will need to determine
  the production versions of each collaborating application from some other
  source (eg. git) and explictly reference each one using one using the format
  `--pacticipant PACTICIPANT1 --version VERSION1 --pacticipant PACTICIPANT2
  --version VERSION2 ...`

  # Other commands

  Check the status of the pacts for the latest pacticipant version. This form is not
  recommended for use in your CI as it is possible that the version you are
  about to deploy is not the the version that the Broker considers the latest.
  It's best to specify the version explictly.

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --latest
  --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  Check the status of the pacts for the latest pacticipant version for a given tag:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT --latest TAG
  --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  Check the status of the pacts between two (or more) specific pacticipant versions:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT1 --version VERSION1
  --pacticipant PACTICIPANT2 --version VERSION2 --broker-base-url
  BROKER_BASE_URL

  Check the status of the pacts between the latest versions of two (or more)
  pacticipants:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT1 --latest --pacticipant
  PACTICIPANT2 --latest --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL

  Check the status of the pacts between the latest versions of two (or more)
  pacticipants with a given tag:

  $ pact-broker can-i-deploy --pacticipant PACTICIPANT1 --latest TAG1
  --pacticipant PACTICIPANT2 --latest TAG2 --broker-base-url BROKER_BASE_URL
